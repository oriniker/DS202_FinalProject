## Water Quality Data

***Our Data give water quality metrics such as pH, Salinity, and Dissolved Oxygen for various sites (Bay, A, B, C, D) and across many years (1899, 1989-2019).***

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
